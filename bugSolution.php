The solution is to always use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`) when comparing values in PHP.  Strict comparison checks both value and type.

```php
$numString = "10";
$integer = 10;

if ($numString === $integer) {
  echo "Strings are identical"; //This will NOT execute because types are different
}

if ($numString == $integer) {
  echo "Strings are equal"; //This will execute
}

$numString = "10abc";
$integer = 10;

if ($numString === $integer) {
  echo "Strings are identical"; //This will NOT execute
}

if ($numString == $integer) {
  echo "Strings are equal"; //This will NOT execute
}
```

By using strict comparison, you ensure that the comparison is accurate and avoids the unpredictable behavior caused by type juggling.
